The reason why I am writing this is because of the issue I encountered yesterday. I got a new M2 chip Macbook Air, installed VS Code, started a T3 app project.
When I was coding on VS Code, I noticed that the intellisense was not working. It was not suggesting anything, no definitions when I hover over methods, etc.

So, the steps I've tried includes:
- Re-installing VS Code
- Restarting laptop

However, none of this fixed the issue. So, after catching some z's, I googled and fortunately found this [answer on Stackoverflow.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57770473/how-to-enable-hover-in-vs-code), which solved my issue.
It turns out that the built-in extension, <strong>Typescript and Javascript Language Features</strong> was not enabled. 

Steps to fix:
1. Open <strong>Extensions</strong> in VS Code sidebar.
2. Search for <strong>@bulitin</strong>. You can hide Themes and Programming Languages sections.
3. Under <strong>Features</strong>, scroll down to the bottom and click on <strong>Typescript and Javascript Language Features</strong>. 
4. Enable the extension. 
5. Go back to your JS/TS file. The issue should be fixed.

Happy coding (at ungodly hours in the morning).
