          <p>
            After graduating with a biology degree at UC Riverside in 2017,
            worked as a lab assistant in biocontrol research for UC Berkeley. I
            worked with parasitoid wasps and fruit flies. While that was
            interesting and allowed me to travel around for experiemtns, it
            wasn&#39;t what I wanted to continue doing for long-term.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            While working at the lab, I decided to take web development night
            classes at a local tech startup called Bitwise Industries (Fresno,
            California) - which is simply an awesome place with awesome people
            from diverse backgrounds. I took all the courses they offered (from
            HTML5 and CSS3 to Angular2). After that, I decided to pursue a
            career in tech, so I studied on my own before getting selected in a
            highly selective software engineering immersive program in Los
            Angeles. From there, I learnt about data structures, Big-O notation,
            MERN stack, databases, and some devops (Docker, CI/CD, AWS).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After finishing the program, COVID hit the US, did not code for a
            year due to burnout. In 2021, I decided to take an backend
            development class in Python/Django (which is just magical). Now, I
            work from home as a React frond-end developer and continuing to
            learn everyday. In my free time, I like to spend time with my cat,
            draw digitally, learn languages, and be a foodie.
