  paragraphOne:
    "I spent early childhood in Southern China, moved to New York then to the San Francisco, and then settled in Fresno, California. As a kid, I loved to draw (still one of my hobbies), travel, and anything related to dinosaurs and cars. I still draw digitally for a hobby, since I am a huge manga & anime fan. I go on road-trips to the coast for whale-watching at Monterey Bay once in a while. Animals fascinate me and the ocean always calms me down when I feel anxious. I studied biology at UC Riverside, then worked in agricultural research (worked with insects). While that was interesting and allowed me to travel around, it wasn't what I wanted to continue doing for long.",
  paragraphTwo:
    "In 2018, I ended up taking web development night classes at a local tech startup called Bitwise Industries - simply an awesome environment with wonderful people. I took all the web development courses they offered (from HTML5 and CSS3 to Angular 4). After that, I decided to pursue a career in tech, so I studied on my own before getting selected in a highly selective software engineering immersive program in Los Angeles (Codesmith, LA). From there, I learnt about data structures, Big-O notation, MERN stack, SQL, and some devops (Docker, CI/CD, AWS). ",
  paragraphThree:
    "After finishing the program, COVID hit the US, so eventually I felt depressed and burnt out (did not code for a year). In spring 2021, I decided to take an backend development class in python/Django, which is just magical! Now, I work from home as a React frond-end developer and still learning everyday.",
