  "After graduating with a biology degree at UC Riverside in 2017,worked as a lab assistant in biocontrol research for UC Berkeley. I worked with parasitoid wasps and fruit flies. While that was interesting and allowed me to travel around for experiemtns, it wasn't what I wanted to continue doing for long-term. ",
  "In 2018, I ended up taking web development night classes at a local tech startup called Bitwise Industries - simply an awesome environment with wonderful people. I took all the web development courses they offered (from HTML5 and CSS3 to Angular 4). After that, I decided to pursue a career in tech, so I studied on my own before getting selected in a highly selective software engineering immersive program in Los Angeles (Codesmith, LA). From there, I learnt about data structures, Big-O notation, MERN stack, SQL, and some devops (Docker, CI/CD, AWS). ",
  "After finishing the program, COVID hit the US, so eventually I felt depressed and burnt out (did not code for a year). In spring 2021, I decided to take an backend development class in python/Django, which is just magical! Now, I work from home as a React frond-end developer and still learning everyday.",
  "In my free time, I like to travel (especially to the beach), draw digitally, watch anime, try new food, spend time with my leopard geckos and cat.",
